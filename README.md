**getSeed**
=============
The purpose of this Spigot plugin is for OPs or players with the correct perms to get the seed for their current world in a more colorful way. Additionally, this plugin is multi-world compatible. If a player issues the command "/seed", this plugin will return the seed of the current world they are in, not the default world's seed. If two players are in two different worlds that have two different seeds, each player issusing the command, assuming they do have the permissions or are OP, will recieve the world seed respective to the world they each are in.
